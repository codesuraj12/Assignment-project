                My design process typically involves four key phases: research, design, prototype, and test. In the research phase, I gather insights about the user, goal their problems, and the market they're in. In the design phase, I create wireframes and visual designs that meet their goals and solve their problems. Throughout the design process, I create prototypes to facilitate testing or feedback. In the test phase, I collect feedback from users to refine the design.
